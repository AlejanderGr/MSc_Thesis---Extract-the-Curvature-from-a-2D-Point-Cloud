# MSc_Thesis---Extract-the-Curvature-from-a-2D-Point-Cloud
The first step is to extract the feature that we are going to use. This was chosen to be the curvature due to itâ€™s very important characteristic of the independence from the Coordinate System. We present 4 techniques . The best one is this on the file calcCurvParam2nd and this is the one that we used on our final experiments.

cacalcCurv2nd: Estimate the function y(x) using 2nd order Polynomials in every step

calcCurv6th: Estimate the function y(x) using 5th order Polynomials. We devide the cloud into proper regions and do a new estimate for every region 

calcCurvParam5th: We extract the parametrical functions x(s) y(s) where s it the length from the starting point. Afterwards we estimate this two functions using one 5th order polynomial for each of them.
